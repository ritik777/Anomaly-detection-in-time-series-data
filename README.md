# Anomaly-detection-in-time-series-data

# Description
This is a jupyter notebook for the anomaly detection project of equipment failure using machine learning best practices on time series data. (kaggle case study)

# Approach 
Cleaned the data

Performed Exploratory data analysis and then implemented algorithms that gives anomaly points.

Plotted time plots with anomalies pointed as red for each algorithm to reach the best model. 

# Machine Learning Algorithms Implemented to predict anomalies
1) K-Means Clustering
2) Gaussian
3) Isolation Forest
4) One Way SVM

# Conclusion and Recommendation
Extreme temperatures seems the culprit but I would like to gauge opinion based on clustering or gaussian technique for deploying purpose because of more subtle outputs that match with the case of higher temperatures usually resulting in equipment failure

# Gaussian Output
